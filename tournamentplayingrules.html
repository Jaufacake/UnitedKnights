                                    <li><span class="play-colour">TOUCH - MOVE RULE </span>- If a Player touches a piece, they must move that piece.
                                        This rule does not apply if that piece has no legal moves or if the player
                                        touched it accidentally - for example, whilst reaching out for another piece.
                                        Part of the touch rules is that you must announce when you are adjusting your
                                        pieces without intending to move them. You can also only adjust your pieces when
                                        your clock is running.</li>
                                    <li><span class="play-colour">ONE HAND RULE</span> - In tournaments, players must make their moves with only one hand.
                                        You must use the same hand to press the clock to stop your times and begin your
                                        opponent’s.This helps to avoid any confusion with castling or taking your opponent’s
                                        piece.</li>
                                    <li>
                                       <span class="play-colour">FAIR PLAY RULES REGARDING CHEATING </span>- All of your moves must be your own. Do not cheat
                                       in any way. Do not get any help from any other person, including parents, friends,
                                       coaches or any other player. Do not use chess engines, software of any kind, bots, plugins,
                                       browser extensions or any tools that analyse positions during play. 
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span class="play-colour">NOTES AND ELECTRONIC DEVICES</span> - You are not allowed to have any kind of electronic device
                                        or study notes on you during a chess match. This can lead to disqualification from the tournament.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span class="play-colour">MULTIPLE DRAW OFFERS</span> - It is considered unsporting and is often outright banned to offer draws in
                                        quick succession. As you can imagine, constantly receiving a draw offer would be distracting and frustrating.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span class="play-colour">COMMUNICATING WITH OTHER PLAYERS / SILENT ZONES </span>- In the playing hall, coaches and volunteers cannot make noise
                                        or communicate with the players. Players also cannot communicate with each other during play. The consequences
                                        for these actions may vary, but will usually only merit a warning rather than a disqualification or time penalty.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span class="play-colour">LEAVING THE TOURNAMENT PLAYING HALL </span>- If a player needs to use the bathroom during a chess game,
                                        you will have to let either a coach or a volunteer know. Additionally, you can only leave while your clock is running.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span class="play-colour">ANY QUESTIONS DURING PLAY </span>- Please raise your hands and a Coach or Volunteer wearing a United Knights Staff Badge will come and assist you.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>

                                    </li>
                                    <li>
