                                    Half Point Byes may be requested (or a request may be cancelled) either: - At the time
                                    of entry, or - At any point before the conclusion of the previous round in the
                                    tournament being played. (ie for a bye in round 3 the request must be made by the
                                    time the last game of round 2 is completed). - Such requests are made by informing
                                    the Organiser at the event, or by sending a text message to: 07786 032 617. </p> <p>Bye requests
                                    missed by the organisers that have not been sent to the correct contact details will not
                                    have their request granted, and will instead score a 0 point bye in that round if the
                                    player chooses or is unable to play this game. A player will score 0 if a Half Point Bye
                                    is requested in the last round. If a tournament permits two Half Point Byes, then a player
                                    will score 0 if the second Half Point Bye request is in the last round, or if both the
                                    Half Point Byes are requested in the last two rounds. Players who miss more rounds than
                                    the number of Half Point Byes permitted in each tournament will be withdrawn from the
                                    tournament unless the Head Organiser decides otherwise.

                                <p>
                                    A player who defaults a game will not be included in the pairings for the next round of the tournament,
                                    or any subsequent round, unless the Head Organiser decides otherwise. Should this be decided, the
                                    Head Organiser reserves the right to apply a bond of £50, which will be returned at the end of the
                                    tournament if the player takes part in all remaining rounds. A player who defaults a second game in
                                    the tournament will be expelled from it, and shall not have the bond returned to him.
                                </p>

                                <h2><span class="play-colour">LATE PAIRINGS</span></h2>
                                <p>
                                    The Organisers may permit players to enter after the pairings have been published for Round 1 of a
                                    tournament. In general, these players will score 0 points in the rounds they have missed. However,
                                    the player may be paired against another player in this category, who has entered the same tournament,
                                    and that game shall be played as though part of the tournament. Should any players remain after this
                                    process, then they will be considered available for any of the pairing procedures below.
                                </p>

                                <h2><span class="play-colour">RE-PAIRINGS</span></h2>
                                <p>
                                    A player whose opponent does not arrive before the default time will be offered a re-pairing against
                                    someone in the same tournament as them. The player will have the following choices: </br>
                                    (1) Accept the re-pairing </br>
                                    (2) Decline the re-pairing, and have a 1 point bye. </br>
                                    If the player decides to accept the re-pairing, then the game will be played as though part of the tournament.
                                    The time limit for the game shall be decided on a case-by-case basis.
                                </p>

                                <h2><span class="play-colour">CROSS-PAIRINGS</span></h2>
                                <p>
                                    Should a re-pairing against someone in the same tournament not be possible, then a player may
                                    be offered a cross-pairing against a player who has entered a different section running concurrently.
                                    The player will have the following choices: </br>
                                    (1) Accept the cross-pairing </br>
                                    (2) Decline the cross-pairing </br>
                                    Games involved in cross pairings will only count towards rating and each player will
                                    get 1 point bye in their tournament. The time limit for the game shall be decided on a
                                    case-by-case basis.
                                </p>

                                <h2><span class="play-colour">FILLER PAIRINGS</span></h2>
                                <p>
                                    Filler pairings Should neither a re-pairing nor a cross-pairing be possible, then the
                                    player may be offered a game against a filler. This will be a player who is not playing
                                    in any tournament going on at the time, but is nevertheless able to play a game at that
                                    time. The player will have the following choices: </br>
                                    (1) Accept the filler pairing </br>
                                    (2) Decline the filler pairing, and have a 1 point bye. </br>
                                    If the player decides to accept the filler pairing, then the game will count as part of
                                    the tournament only if the filler is eligible to play in the tournament. If the player
                                    is not eligible, then the player will get 1 point bye in their tournament. The time
                                    limit for the game shall be decided on a case-by-case basis.
                                </p>

                                    During a game, a player is forbidden to have any electronic device not specifically approved by the Organisers in the playing venue. United Knights Tournaments will permit such devices to be stored in a player’s bag, provided the device is completely switched off. This bag must be placed as agreed with the Head Organiser. Both players are forbidden to use this bag without permission of the Head Organiser. Alternatively, the device may be placed in a pieces bag or clock box closed and placed within the sight of both players. (in this context, devices shall include but not be limited to :- mobile phones, smart watches, fitbits etc.) The only exception to these exclusions are for medical devices. All medical devices must be identified to the Head Organisers, and cleared by them, before each competition starts. If in doubt about any device that you are wearing, get the device cleared by the Head Organiser controlling your section. If it is evident that a player has such a device on their person in the playing venue, the player shall lose the game. The opponent shall win.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Any concerns about cheating should be brought to the attention of the Head Organiser and nobody else. The Head Organiser will handle the situation. Please do not raise concerns with anyone else. Players are reminded they must not talk about a game in progress with anyone.
                                </p>
