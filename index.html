											<h2>Welcome to United Knights
											</h2>
										</header>
										<p class="comic-neue-regular">Hello, my name is Fai Ally and I am extremely passionate
											about teaching chess to children in Primary Schools in a fun and exciting way!
										</p>

										<p>
											Inspired by my daughter who had many challenges throughout her chess journey in
											her primary years and can proudly say she held the title - UK18 Girls Chess
											Champion for England for 5 years Nationally and Internationally. 
										</p>
									</div>

										</ul> -->

									<span class="image"><img src="images/fai.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								</div>

								<p>
											Throughout my journey as a parent, it was an eye opener to witness many disappointed
											children who worked so hard and would like to achieve a title; or win 1st, 2nd or 3rd
											place or any type of award or trophy … so I wanted to make that change by teaching
											chess in a fun and exciting way through encouraging and motivating children to learn
											how to play chess and rewarding them when they deserve to be rewarded! Having fun … it’s the best way to learn!
										</p>

										<img class="images-styles" src="images/kids.jpg" alt="Chess Club"/>

										<p>
											Our Chess Club Services which we find genuinely unique – includes learning tactics, strategies
											and developing their knowledge in playing chess. The children will build their competitive spirit
											and confidence in no time and will experience different ways of playing real time chess over the
											board so they engage. 
										</p>

										<img class="images-styles" src="images/awards.jpg" alt="Tournament Awards"/>

										<p>
											Nothing like a bit of fun with one of our Termly Chess Tournaments as well as accumulating points
											earned to reach the United Knights Levels from Pawns to King ... collecting certificates, stickers
											and chess pieces on their dedicated keyring along the way!
										</p>
										
										<img class="images-styles" src="images/barchart.png" alt="Point System" width="500px" height="500px"/>

										<p>
											Playing chess games with other children will give them the ability to practise what they have learned
											and enables children to work at their own pace with no additional pressure. We match like for like so
											it’s not overwhelming for any child. Slowly but surely, you will notice the great benefits your child
											has gained as demonstrated below.

									<h2>Our Chess Club Sessions</h2>
								</header>
								
								<p>
									United Knights offer to make every single session exciting and motivating for each unique child…
									no matter what their chess ability is; special or medical needs are! 
								</p>

								<h3><span class="play-colour">Learning Chess the Fun and Rewarding Way!</span></h3>

								<p>
									We're not just teaching a game — we're shaping confident, strategic thinkers one move at a time. Chess
									is more than just a board game and is a three part process from beginning to end - the basic play and
									opening, the middle and the end game. It's a brilliant way for children to learn focus, patience,
									resilience, and critical thinking. That’s why we’re proud to offer a unique chess coaching program
									that makes learning fun, competitive, and deeply rewarding.
								</p>

								<h2 class="subtitles">Why Chess?</h2>

								<p>
									When children play chess, they’re developing valuable life skills without even realising it.
									Our sessions are designed to create a vibrant, encouraging environment where every child —
									regardless of their starting point — can grow, learn, and shine!
								</p>

								<h2 class="subtitles">What Makes United Knights Chess Clubs Special?</h2>

								<p>
									We’ve designed our coaching to be as engaging as it is educational:
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li><p>🧠 <span class="play-colour">Tactics and Strategy First</span> – Every session begins with a new chess concept, tactic, or strategy. Children are encouraged (and rewarded!) for applying what they've learned in their games.</p></li>
									<li><p>🏅 <span class="play-colour">Positive Points System</span> – Win or not, every child earns points in each game. This ensures that effort, learning, and participation are always recognised.</p></li>
									<li><p>🏆 <span class="play-colour">Termly Tournaments</span> – At the end of each term, we host a variety of exciting tournaments. Prizes include engraved Trophies for Champions, shiny Silver and Bronze Medals handed out during school assemblies and Certificates  handed out in the Chess Club sessions.</p></li>
									<li><p>🌟 <span class="play-colour">Player of the Week</span> – Each week, we spotlight one child for their effort, improvement, or sportsmanship — because we believe every child deserves their moment.</p></li>
									<li><p>🤝 <span class="play-colour">Inclusive Play</span> – Children are paired by ability, not age or grade, so everyone competes on equal footing and develops at their own pace, pressure-free.</p></li>
									<li><p>♟ <span class="play-colour">The Levels System</span> – Our fun progress tracker lets children work their way up from Pawn to King, earning certificates and collectible chess piece keyrings along the way!</p></li>
									<li><p>🏫 <span class="play-colour">Beyond the Club</span> – We support children in taking part in school and inter-school competitions, helping them grow in confidence and represent their school with pride.</p></li>
								</ul>

								<h2 class="subtitles">Learning Through Play</h2>

								<p>
									More than anything, we believe learning happens best when it’s fun. Our club is a place where
									friendships are formed over the chessboard, laughter is heard between rounds, and every child
									feels valued — whether they’re learning their first moves or refining their opening gambits.
								</p>

								<h2 class="subtitles">Ready to Join the Chess Fun?</h2>

								<p>
									If you’d like your child to be part of something both fun and enriching, our chess club is
									the perfect place to start. Let’s give them the chance to play, learn, and grow — all through
									the beautiful game of chess! Simply click on the link <a href="https://united-knights.classforkids.io">United Knights</a> to access your child(ren)'s school for
